# Monitoring drug treatment against cancer

The project requires the use of automatic control techniques for the pharmacological treatment of cells carcinogenic in laboratory environments.

The project is developed in six sequential steps:

1) System in state form and linearization:
   - State form
   - Equilibrium couple
   - Linearization

2) Transfer function

3) Regulator design
   - Static regulator
   - Dynamic regulator

4) Test of the control system on the linear model
   - Step response
   - Exit disorder
   - Measurement disturbance
   - Sensitivity functions
  
5) Control system test on the nonlinear model

For the detailed explanation of the requirements of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/AngeloTulbure/automatic-controls-project/blob/main/Angelo_Tulbure_Project_Requirements.pdf), while the explantion of the implementaion of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/AngeloTulbure/automatic-controls-project/blob/main/Angelo_Tulbure_Project_Implementation.pdf).

The first four steps were done in MATLAB and can be found [here](https://github.com/AngeloTulbure/automatic-controls-project/blob/main/Angelo_Tulbure_Project_MATLAB.m), while the last step was done in Simulink and can be found [here](https://github.com/AngeloTulbure/automatic-controls-project/blob/main/Angelo_Tulbure_Project_Simulink.slx).
